Project goals: 

1. 	Create an image comprising of Ubuntu 14.04 and Docker using OpenStack's Disk Image Builder tool

2.  Provision Moonshot servers with the Ubuntu + Docker image using Helion OpenStack

3.  Orchestrate deployment of Docker Containers packaged with a PHP Web app using OpenStack Heat
4
4.  Test portability of Dockerized apps by deploying the same Container on various compute platforms such as Moonshot, Virtual Box VM and Raspberry Pi and verifying whether the app can run without changes and run without having to preinstall the app's runtime (PHP and Apache Webserver in this case)

5.  Test application density by experimenting with how many Docker Containers could be run on a single Moonshot server
